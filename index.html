            Born as Narendranath Dutta on 12th January 1863 in the holy and divine place of Kolkata,
             Swami Vivekananda was a great Indian saint. He was a figure with “high thinking and simple 
             living”. He was a great pious leader, a philosopher, and also a devout personality with great
              principles.  His eminent philosophical works comprise of “Modern Vedanta” and “Raj Yoga”.
               He was a principal disciple of “Ramkrishna Paramhansa” and was an initiator of Ramkrishna
                Math and Ramkrishna Mission. He thus spent his whole life in the dispersion of the values 
                embedded in the great Indian culture.

                        <p>Swami Vivekananda was born in Shim-la Pally in Calcutta on 12 January 1863.
                             He was named Narendranath Datta. His father Vishwanath Datta was an attorney 
                             of Calcutta High Court. His mother was Bhuvaneshwari Devi. Narendranath's thinking
                              and personality were influenced by his parents—the father by his rational 
                              mind and the mother by her religious temperament. From his mother he learnt
                               the power of self-control. Young Narendra was an expert in meditation and 
                               could enter the state of samadhi very easily. He saw a light while falling asleep.
                                Once he had a vision of Buddha during his meditation. During his childhood,
                                 he had a great fascination for wandering ascetics and monks. He was also an
                                  expert in games and naughty things. Even in his young age he showed remarkable
                                   leadership qualities. His childhood friend was Kamal Reddy.

                    <p>Vivekananda's  books on the four Yogas (Raja Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Jnana
                         Yoga) are still seen as fundamental texts for anyone interested in the Windfall 
                         practice of Yoga. His letters are of great literary and spiritual spirit. He was
                          also considered a very good singer and a poet. By the time of his death, he had
                           composed many songs including his favorite song "Kali-The Mother". He used humor 
                           for his teachings and was also an excellent cook. His language is very free flowing.
                            These all works were compiled to form a 9 volume set "The Complete Works of Swami
                             Vivekananda". A book titles 'Selections from the Complete Works of Swami
                              Vivekananda' is also very popular, knowledgeable and inspiring.
